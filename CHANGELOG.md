- Refactored logic in AsyncClient to load markets and tokens, to ensure there are no duplicated tokens with the same denom

## [0.9.12]

* Synchronized markets and tokens config files to add USDY/USDT and WHALE/USDT spot markets

## [0.9.8]
* Synchronized markets and tokens config files to add PYTH/USDT spot market

## [0.9.7]
* Added PYTH/USDT PERP market info in mainnet metadata ini file

## [0.9.6]
* Synchronized denom ini files with Indexer information for mainnet, testnet and devnet to include TALIS/INJ and KUJI/USDT markets

## [0.9.5]
* Updated fetch_metadata script (to synchronize denom ini files) to reuse logic in AsyncClient
* Synchronized denom ini files with Indexer information for mainnet, testnet and devnet

## [0.9.4]
* Added TIA/USDT spot market in mainnet and testnet ini file

## [0.9.3]
* Updated TIA/USDT-30NOV2023 market id in denoms_mainnet.ini file

## [0.9.2]
* Added fix to the grpc import error in Mac with M1 and M2 chips

## [0.9.1]
* Added new spot markets in mainnet ini file: KAVA/USDT, USDTkv/USDT
* Added new derivative markets in mainnet ini file: TIA/USDT-30NOV2023, AXL/USDT, BTC/USDTkv, ETH/USDTkv

## [0.9.0]
* Improvement in broadcaster to initialize the account sequence number and the timeout height only when required
* Replace Pipenv with Poetry
* Add pre-commit validations to the project
* Add a GitHub workflow to run all tests and calculate coverage for each PR


## [0.8.5]
* Added NEOK/USDT and ORAI/USDT spot markets to the mainnet .ini file

## [0.8.4]
* Added methods to SpotMarket, DerivativeMarket and BianaryOptionMarket to translate chain prices and quantities to human-readable format.

## [0.8.3]
* Fix dependency issue in setup.py.

## [0.8.2]
* Add web3 library as a dependency for the project.

## [0.8.1]
* Moved the configuration to use a secure or insecure connection inside the Network class. The AsyncClient's `insecure` parameter is no longer used for anything and will be removed in the future.
* Made the new load balanced bare-metal node the default one for mainnet (it is called `lb`). The legacy one (load balanced k8s node) is called `lb_k8s`

## [0.8]
* Refactor Composer to be created with all the markets and tokens. The Composer now uses the real markets and tokens to convert human-readable values to chain format
* The Composer can still be instantiated without markets and tokens. When markets and tokens are not provided the Composer loads the required information from the Denoms used in previous versions
* Change in AsyncClient to be able to create Composer instances for the client network, markets and tokens
* Examples have been adapted to create Composer instances using the AsyncClient
* Added new nodes (bare-metal load balancing nodes) for mainnet and testnet
* Deprecated the kubernetes load balanced nodes for testnet
* Refactored the cookies management logic into a cookie assistant. Added the required logic to support the new cookies format for bare-metal load balanced nodes
* Removed class Client. The only supported now is the async version called AsyncClient.

## [0.7.1.1]
* Fixed Testnet network URLs

## [0.7.2.1]

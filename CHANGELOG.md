## [0.8.5]
* Added NEOK/USDT and ORAI/USDT spot markets to the mainnet .ini file

## [0.8.4]
* Added methods to SpotMarket, DerivativeMarket and BianaryOptionMarket to translate chain prices and quantities to human-readable format.

## [0.8.3]
* Fix dependency issue in setup.py.

## [0.8.2]
* Add web3 library as a dependency for the project.

## [0.8.1]
* Moved the configuration to use a secure or insecure connection inside the Network class. The AsyncClient's `insecure` parameter is no longer used for anything and will be removed in the future.

* Change in AsyncClient to be able to create Composer instances for the client network, markets and tokens
* Examples have been adapted to create Composer instances using the AsyncClient

* Deprecated the kubernetes load balanced nodes for testnet
* Refactored the cookies management logic into a cookie assistant. Added the required logic to support the new cookies format for bare-metal load balanced nodes
